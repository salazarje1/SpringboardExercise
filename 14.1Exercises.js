// Part One: Solidify Terminology
    // In your own terms, define the following terms:

    // What is HTTP?
    // HTTP is protocol in the application layer, stand for hypertext transfer protocol.

    // What is a URL?
    // is string of characters used to find pages in the browser, replace ip addresses, add query strings, and more. 

    // What is DNS?
    // Domain Name Service or servers are used to find the ip address of the webpage your seaching for. 

    // What is a query string?
    // goes at the end of a get request. Key/value pair used to send extra information in the URL

    // What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    // Get and Post 
        // Get - is used to retrieve data without change anythin g
        // Post - is used to change things or modify. 

    // What is an HTTP request?
    // a request is what the browser sends the server, asking for information or files.

    // What is an HTTP response?
    // a response is what the server sends back to the browser, with the information requested  

    // What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    // an HTTP header is where extra information is sent, either about the request or response or about the device itself
        // a couple examples are: cookies, language, content type, 

    // What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
        // First the browser sends a request looking for the ip address for the website 
        // Then send another request to the server with the ip address replacing the name 
        // The server gets the request and looks for the information being requested 
        // Gets a response ready and send it to the broswer 

        // These are very simple steps, it is much much more complicated.
